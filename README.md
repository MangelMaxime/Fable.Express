# Npm bindings

The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of Npm bindings and mutualize the infrastructure code to lower the maintenance cost.

For each bindings, you can find the documentation in the `README.md` file from their respective folders.

You can also take a look at the `tests` folder. Each binding comes with his own set of tests. Currently, we have around 450 tests.
